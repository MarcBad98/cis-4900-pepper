# Testing requests for REST calls

Making REST calls using Python's requests package is an important feature to test. Being able to connect to the Internet extends Pepper's capabilities and functionalities. For example, rather than relying on Pepper's built-in speech-to-text services (which only allows developers to set a list of words for pattern matching), developers can instead opt to send audio files to speech-to-text cloud services.

## Retrieve ISS Data

This Choregraphe project is a small project that uses OpenNotify's API endpoints about the International Space Station. It provides a small demonstration of how REST calls can improve Pepper's usability.

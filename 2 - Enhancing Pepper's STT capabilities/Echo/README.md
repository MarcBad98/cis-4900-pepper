# Extending the `requests` package

After learning that `requests` is available on Pepper's local machine, the first capability to try to enhance was her speech-to-text functions. Currently, Pepper only has a built-in speech-to-text engine that only allows recognition of words from a pre-defined list (using pattern matching). To circumvent defining a set vocabulary, developers can take advantage of Cloud computing and services.

## Echo

This Choregraphe project is a small project that uses [Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text) to transcribe audio files to text. It provides another small demonstration of how REST calls can improve Pepper's usability.

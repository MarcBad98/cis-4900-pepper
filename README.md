## Repository Todo List

- [ ] Setup `0 - Getting started` directory for basic information about handling Pepper and Choregraphe
- [ ] Compile a list of references and tutorials in `0 - Getting started`
- [ ] Setup README.md for each project detailing my experiences

## Further Project Ideas

What seems to be new documentation for QiSDK emerged 2020. What's promising is that, not only is it up to date, but it moves away from Aldebaran documentation and towards Softbank documentation (Aldebaran developed Pepper and NAO before the company's acquisition by Softbank). Developing using QiSDK on the Android Studio IDE may be a promising project in the future.
